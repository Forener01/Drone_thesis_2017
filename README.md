# Drone_thesis_2017

This repo contains several folders used to develop the software running autonomously 
a Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 quadcopter to identify a door in a room and to exit the room through this door.

The code is contained in the Code section. This uses adapted existing packages and new ones. The final demonstration
can be runned by using the demo.launch file located at Drone_thesis_2017/Code/src/thesis_aurian/launch
